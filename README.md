## Hello WorldðŸ‘‹


My name is Luca and I am a graduate in Data Science with a strong interest in economics, finance and quantitative analysis. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and later specialised in Data Science during my Masterâ€™s studies. My interest in probability, statistics, and their applications in areas such as financial markets, algorithmic trading, and machine learning began during my undergraduate years and has only deepened through both my academic journey and my job journey as data scientist before in SAS and now at the European Central Bank.
